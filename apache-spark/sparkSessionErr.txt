In general, it's suggested to use virtual environments (I highly suggest looking at the official Python documentation). With this approach, you easily can set up project-specific Python versions (as well as libraries). Easily manageable and the best part: There are lots of tutorials on the internet on how to approach this:

Using VirtualEnv with multiple Python versions on windows
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/installing-multiple-python-versions-on-windows-using-virtualenv/
etc.
1.) Open command prompt ("cmd") and enter pip install virtualenv.

2.) Install your desired Python version via https://www.python.org/downloads/release; Remember: Do not add to PATH!

3.) Type into the command prompt: virtualenv \path\to\env -p \path\to\python_install.exe, whereas \path\to\env shall be the path where your virtual environment is going to be and \path\to\python_install.exe the one where your freshly (presumably) installed Python version resides.

4.) Done! You now have a virtual environment set up! Now, to activate the virtual environment execute the batch file which is located inside the \path\to\env\Scripts\activate.bat. (cf. this website or an official Python guide)

You can do this with the following steps:

1-conda create -n py36 'python=3.6' ipykernel #Replace 3.6 with desired version.

2-To activate installed jupyter kernal you need run, source activate py36

3-python -m ipykernel install --user

4-The interesting part: if you want to switch between kernels (py2-py3) in the same notebook, you need to run, conda install nb_conda
